Information for Prospective Students
===================================

I receive many inquiries from students who are interested in joining my research group or seeking MS or PhD admission. 
To help set expectations and reduce confusion, this page explains how admissions and funding work at Loyola University Chicago 
and what I look for in prospective members of the Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL), which I direct.

Before Contacting Me
--------------------

If you are interested in working with the Software and Systems Laboratory, please follow these guidelines before requesting a meeting.

1. **Submit a complete application** to Loyola University Chicago at  
   https://gpem.luc.edu/.  
   I am unable to meet with students who have not yet applied through the university's official process.

2. **Ensure that your Statement of Purpose clearly articulates your connection to SSL**.  
   Your application should describe why your background and goals align with our research directions, 
   what areas of SSL's work interest you, and how you see yourself contributing to ongoing projects.

3. **After submitting your application, you may request an appointment via Calendly** (https://calendly.com/gkthiruvathukal).  
   I will only consider meeting with applicants who already have an active application on file. 
   This policy is not meant to be discouraging; it is necessary given the volume of inquiries and my responsibility 
   to prioritize active applicants.

4. **Part-time applicants must have a clear and documented funding plan**,  
   including explicit employer support to dedicate substantial time to research.  
   Without this, part-time study is not compatible with the expectations and demands of SSL projects.
   There are many more established PhD programs that welcome part-time professional applicants.
   We're not quite ready to be one of them.

Admissions and Funding
----------------------

All undergraduate and graduate admissions at Loyola University Chicago are handled centrally by the university. 
Faculty members, including department chairs, cannot personally admit students or guarantee financial support.

For the PhD program, a departmental committee reviews all applications and makes admissions decisions. 
We have a limited number of departmental teaching assistantships each year. 
Research assistantships depend on whether individual faculty members have active grant funding.

Students who hold external national or international fellowships are especially encouraged to apply. 
Applicants with fellowships that provide at least three years of support are typically the most competitive.

Admission to the MS or PhD program does **not** guarantee placement in my lab. 
Lab membership depends on research alignment, preparation, and available funding. 
Prospective students should be prepared to explain how their interests connect to ongoing work in the group. 
**Generic or mass-mailed inquiries cannot--and will not--be considered.**

Expectations for Prospective SSL Members
----------------------------------------

As director of the Software and Systems Laboratory, I oversee a research group focused on systems, 
high-performance computing, software engineering, AI-assisted scientific computing, and interdisciplinary work 
that spans computing and other fields. Because of this breadth and the applied nature of our research, 
we look for students who have strong foundational preparation and can grow into collaborative, long-running projects.

A solid understanding of fundamental computer science topics is essential. 
This includes experience with advanced data structures, systems programming, operating systems, 
and programming languages. Strong Linux/Unix proficiency is expected, as our work involves servers, 
distributed systems, and HPC environments.

We place a high value on excellent software engineering skills, including the use of open-source tools, 
version control (especially GitHub), testing practices, documentation, and collaborative workflows. 
Depending on the project, familiarity with mathematics (discrete mathematics, probability, and linear algebra) 
may be helpful.

Our group actively uses AI tools as part of research workflows, but we expect students to engage with these tools 
critically and not as substitutes for understanding. Intellectual curiosity, a willingness to learn, and comfort with 
complex, open-ended problems are crucial. Students should be able to give and receive constructive feedback. 

Communication skills matter. SSL is not a code-only research group; students are expected to write papers, 
prepare presentations, and contribute to discussions about research methods and evaluation.

Conduct Expectations
--------------------

Professional conduct, reliability, and respect for others are essential. 
We maintain a collaborative, inclusive environment and expect all members to uphold recognized community standards.

Two examples that reflect the spirit of how we operate are:

* Python Community Code of Conduct: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/
* ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct: https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics

These documents articulate widely accepted expectations for respectful behavior, professionalism, 
equity and inclusion, and responsible conduct in computing. 
We expect all SSL members to engage with colleagues in ways consistent with these principles.

How We Work as a Team
---------------------

SSL is a highly collaborative research group. Students typically begin by joining an existing project, 
learning the technical foundation, research questions, and workflow conventions of the group. 
As they develop expertise, students may take on leadership roles and help shape new project directions.

Purely solo projects are rare in our group; however, many solo projects often originate as side projects and become SSL projects.
Students should expect to work closely with peers, faculty, 
and sometimes collaborators at Argonne National Laboratory and other universities (e.g. Purdue University, Northern Illinois University, Northwestern University, and Arizona State University, among others).

As a **world-focused** laboratory, we *greatly* value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we welcome students from **all backgrounds** who are committed 
to a respectful and collaborative research environment.


Recommended Undergraduate Preparation
-------------------------------------

While formal admissions decisions are made centrally by the university, successful applicants to the 
Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL) typically demonstrate strong preparation in several areas of 
computer science that align with the lab’s research directions. The following undergraduate courses 
(from the Loyola University Chicago Computer Science curriculum) are especially relevant for students 
interested in systems, high-performance computing, software engineering, and programming languages.

These courses are not strict requirements as we welcome students at all levels (freshman and beyond),
but students who have taken most of them—or equivalent courses elsewhere—are usually better prepared for SSL’s *graduate* research activities.

**Core Systems and Architecture**

- COMP 264 — Introduction to Computer Systems  
  Provides essential foundations in low-level programming, memory models, and machine-level execution.

- COMP 310 — Operating Systems  
  Covers concurrency, scheduling, resource management, and systems-level design principles.

**High-Performance and Distributed Computing**

- COMP 364 — High Performance Computing  
  Directly aligned with SSL's emphasis on parallelism, scalability, and scientific computing.

- COMP 339 — Distributed Systems  
  Important for understanding large-scale systems, coordination, distributed communication, and reliability.

- COMP 343 — Computer Networks  
  Supports work involving data movement, performance tuning, and distributed protocol behavior.

**Software Engineering and Collaborative Development**

- COMP 330 — Software Engineering  
  Reinforces structured development practices, testing, documentation, and collaborative open-source workflows.

**Programming Languages and Algorithmic Foundations**

- COMP 371 — Programming Languages  
  Useful for understanding language features, runtime systems, compilers, and program analysis.

- COMP 363 — Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms  
  Critical for algorithmic thinking, performance reasoning, and efficient problem-solving.

**Data Structures and Core CS Fundamentals**

- COMP 271 — Data Structures I  
- COMP 272 — Data Structures II  

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**

- COMP 378 — Artificial Intelligence
  Introduces core AI theory and programming concepts. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- COMP 379 — Machine Learning
  Covers supervised/unsupervised learning, predictive modelling and data-driven algorithms. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- COMP 387 — Deep Learning
  Focuses on neural networks, modern architectures, and applications in vision and language. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}


These courses provide the fundamental data structure knowledge necessary for systems programming, 
distributed systems, and high-performance software design.

Students who have completed most of the courses listed above—or who can demonstrate equivalent 
experience through industry work, open-source contributions, or independent projects—are typically 
well prepared to engage with SSL's research projects and collaborate effectively within the group.

Preparing a Strong Inquiry
--------------------------

Students who wish to express interest in working with the lab should begin by reading several of our recent publications 
and briefly describing how their background aligns with specific projects.

Thoughtful inquiries that demonstrate familiarity with our work are far more likely to be considered 
than generic requests.

Prospective students should also be prepared to learn independently, read papers on their own initiative, 
and demonstrate evidence of technical depth through coursework, projects, open-source contributions, 
or prior research experience.

This page serves as a starting point. For formal application procedures, please consult Loyola University Chicago’s 
`official admissions resources <https://gpem.luc.edu>`__.
