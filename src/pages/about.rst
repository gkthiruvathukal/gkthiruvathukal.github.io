About Me
========

Hi! I’m George.
I am a full professor of computer science and chairperson of the same at Loyola University Chicago, as well as a visiting computer scientist at Argonne National Laboratory.

I double-majored in computer science and physics and nearly majored in mathematics at Lewis University in Romeoville, IL.
I earned a PhD in computer science from the Illinois Institute of Technology under the supervision of `Thomas W. Christopher <https://tools-of-computing.com/>`__.
My doctoral work involved creating messaging middleware to support parallel and distributed computation on computing clusters and networks of workstations (primarily in C/C++ and Java).
My postdoctoral work was a continuation of my work on messaging middleware (Message Passing Interface for Globus and grid computing) under the supervision of `Ian T. Foster <https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster>`__ at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago. 

My research and teaching interests include high-performance computing and distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, and machine learning.
I am also interested in interdisciplinary computing, working in computational science, data science, and digital humanities and arts/music.

My recent work focuses on energy-efficient computer vision and empirical software engineering.
My research has been funded by government agencies such as NSF, DARPA, NSA, and NEH, and I have received research and education-related gifts from industry leaders including Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

My academic career has been somewhat non-linear.
From 1990-1997, I held full-time and consulting positions in the industry, culminating as a senior member of technical staff as a *software engineer* and *development manager*.
This experience helped develop the leadership and organizational skills required of a department chairperson. Otherwise, I think I would have to be hospitalized.

At Loyola, I have served as the undergraduate program director (in 2004) and the graduate program director (from 2004-2006).
Beyond my university service, I have been the editor-in-chief (EIC) of IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering Magazine (from 2013-2016), associate EIC of IEEE Computer (from 2016-2019), and chaired the Magazine Operations Committee (from 2017-2018) after my EIC service.
I have also served on the Publications Board, overseeing transactions and magazines published by the IEEE Computer Society.

Currently, I am a member of the IEEE Computer Advisory Board and an editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence track).

Beyond my roles as a department chair and professor, I returned to school in January 2023 to study jazz piano performance with
`Lara Driscoll <https://laradriscoll.com/>`__; she is my first actual *piano* teacher!
I have also been blessed to have other mentors, including `Jack Cassidy <https://www.jackcassidymusic.com/>`__, `Victor Garcia <https://victorgarciamusic.com/>`__, `Chris Madsen <https://www.luc.edu/dfpa/facultyandstaffdirectory/profiles/christophermadsendma.shtml>`__, `Michael Nearpass <https://www.oldtownschool.org/teachers/Michael-Nearpass/>`__.
I don't know if my chairperson life will permit me to finish a degree in music and jazz performance, but I love this group of musicians for bringing out the best in me and helping me to grow as an improviser and composer.
Wish me luck.
