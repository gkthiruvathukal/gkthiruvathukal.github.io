A Jazz Piano Playlist for Inspiration and Practice
==================================================

:bdg-primary:`Blog Post` :bdg-primary-line:`Software Engineering`

Jazz pianists draw inspiration from a long lineage of extraordinary players whose recordings continue to shape how we learn, practice, and perform.
This playlist brings together influential tracks from several eras—bebop, modal jazz, post-bop, and more—curated to support both listening enjoyment and focused practice.

The selections reflect artists who have shaped my own musical development, including Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, and Hank Mobley (whose recordings feature some of the greatest rhythm-section pianists).
These tracks offer a balance of harmonic sophistication, rhythmic subtlety, and improvisational depth.

How to use this playlist
------------------------

You can use these recordings in multiple ways:

* **Active listening** to study phrasing, harmonic movement, and voicings.
* **Slow-down practice** using tools like Transcribe!, Anytune, or music-speed apps.
* **Repertoire building** by identifying tunes you may want to learn and add to your sets.
* **Improvisation study** by isolating recurring patterns, motifs, and left-hand techniques.

Highlights
----------

While the playlist evolves, several timeless artists consistently anchor it:

* **Keith Jarrett** – introspective, lyrical phrasing with unmatched dynamic control.  
* **Herbie Hancock** – harmonic versatility spanning multiple jazz eras.  
* **Hank Mobley** – a tenor saxophonist whose recordings showcase inventive comping from top-tier pianists.  

These tracks offer a rich foundation for developing vocabulary, time feel, and touch.
