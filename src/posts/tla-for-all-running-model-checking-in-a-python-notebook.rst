TLA+ for All: Running Model Checking in a Python Notebook
=========================================================

TLA+ has long been a powerful tool for designing and verifying complex systems.
However, many students and practitioners have felt excluded by the ecosystem’s complexity, the need to install multiple tools, or the misconception that formal methods are only for specialists.
This project aims to change that.

By integrating TLA+ model checking directly into a Python notebook environment, we make formal specification and verification accessible to anyone who can open a browser.
Instead of requiring specialized tooling, users can write specifications, run the TLC model checker, explore traces, and visualize behaviors—all within a familiar computational notebook workflow.

Why notebooks?
--------------

Computational notebooks are already widely used for data science, simulation, and teaching.
Embedding TLA+ into this environment enables:

* barrier-free access to model checking,
* the ability to annotate specifications with narrative explanation,
* integration with example data, visualizations, and experiments,
* reproducibility for classroom and research settings.

This approach supports learners encountering formal methods for the first time, researchers building executable documentation, and engineers who want to explore system behaviors without wrestling with installation steps.

Key benefits
------------

* Makes TLA+ accessible through a fully browser-based workflow.
* Encourages literate modeling—combining specification, explanation, and results.
* Avoids challenging setup or complex toolchains.
* Ideal for teaching, tutorials, workshops, and exploratory modeling.
