Abstract
--------
Zero Involvement Pairing and Authentication (ZIPA) is a promising technique for auto-provisioning large networks of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
In this work, we present the first successful signal-injection attack on a ZIPA system. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
Most existing ZIPA systems assume there is a negligible amount of influence from the unsecured outside space on the secured inside space. In reality, environmental signals do leak from adjacent unsecured spaces and influence the environment of the secured space. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
Our attack takes advantage of this fact to perform a signal injection on the popular Schürmann & Sigg algorithm. The keys generated by the adversary under a signal injection attack at 95 dBA are within the standard error of the legitimate device. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Key Contributions
-----------------
* Demonstration of a practical signal-injection attack against ZIPA systems.
* Empirical results showing that adversary-generated keys are statistically indistinguishable from legitimate keys under specified conditions.
* Discussion of the assumptions underlying ZIPA schemes and how environmental leakage can violate those assumptions.
* Insights for designers of IoT auto-provisioning systems regarding threat models and mitigation considerations.

Background: ZIPA & the Schürmann & Sigg Algorithm
------------------------------------------------
ZIPA (Zero Involvement Pairing and Authentication) schemes aim to simplify provisioning for IoT networks by minimizing user involvement.
The Schürmann & Sigg algorithm is a representative ZIPA technique that exploits ambient signal correlation for key generation between nearby devices.
Prior work assumed minimal adversarial influence on the ambient signals used by legitimate devices; this assumption is re-examined in this work.

Threat Model & Attack Overview
------------------------------
The adversary places a signal-injection device into the environment of the target ZIPA pair.
By broadcasting a signal at ~95 dBA, the attacker influences the ambient channel so that the key‐generation process of the target devices becomes predictable.
The resulting adversary-generated key matches the key of the legitimate pairing device within measurement error bounds.

Experimental Setup & Results
----------------------------
The authors implement their attack in a controlled environment using audio signals and ZIPA device prototypes.
They measure ambient correlation, key agreement rates, and error rates with and without the injection.
Results show that under injection the adversary recovers keys with success rates that breach the intended security guarantee of the ZIPA system.

Discussion & Mitigations
------------------------
The work highlights how assumptions about “safe ambient channels” in ZIPA schemes can be unrealistic in real-world settings.
Possible mitigation strategies include:
- Monitoring for abnormal ambient signal power or introducing randomness in the ambient channel measurement.
- Rejecting key generation when ambient leakage is detected or channel conditions are out of expected range.
- Incorporating active challenge-response or authenticated provisioning steps rather than purely passive ambient schemes.

Conclusion
----------
This paper demonstrates the first signal-injection attack on ZIPA systems and shows that ambient-signal based pairing is vulnerable to adversarial injection even at moderate signal levels (~95 dBA).
Designers of large-scale IoT auto-provisioning systems should treat ZIPA schemes with caution and adopt stronger threat models and mitigations.

Engineers can reduce costs by reusing a pre-trained model (PTM) and fine-tuning it for their own tasks. To facilitate software reuse, engineers collaborate around model hubs, collections of PTMs and datasets organized by problem domain. Although model hubs are now comparable in popularity and size to other software ecosystems, the associated PTM supply chain has not yet been examined from a software engineering perspective. We present an empirical study of artifacts and security features in 8 model hubs. We indicate the potential threat models and show that the existing defenses are insufficient for ensuring the security of PTMs. We compare PTM and traditional supply chains, and propose directions for further measurements and tools to increase the reliability of the PTM supply chain.},
