Special Issue on Low-Code/No-Code + Metaverse in IEEE Computer
==============================================================

Low-code/no-code is increasingly converging with the metaverse to reshape how we create and experience technology.
As AI-driven tools automate significant portions of coding and power immersive virtual environments, organizations can achieve new efficiencies—provided that security, ethics, and user empowerment remain central.

Low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms are changing software development by enabling non-technical users to build applications quickly.
At the same time, the metaverse, with its avatars, holograms, and extended reality, is transforming domains such as entertainment, health care, and education by enabling rich, immersive experiences.
Both LC/NC and the metaverse are increasingly driven by advances in generative AI, which can automate code generation and support more human-like interactions in virtual spaces.

Despite this potential, important challenges remain.
LC/NC raises questions about reliability, security, and explainability, especially when paired with powerful AI tools.
The metaverse, while promising unprecedented sensory immersion, must confront issues of data privacy and the potential for large-scale societal influence.
As these technologies evolve together, stakeholders need to balance innovation with risk, ensuring their adoption supports both efficiency and ethical standards.

Key take-aways
--------------

* LC/NC tools can dramatically lower barriers to software development.
* The metaverse’s immersive capabilities are transforming multiple industries.
* Generative AI is a key driver for both LC/NC and metaverse technologies.
* Strong security, training, and ongoing oversight are critical for sustainable adoption.
