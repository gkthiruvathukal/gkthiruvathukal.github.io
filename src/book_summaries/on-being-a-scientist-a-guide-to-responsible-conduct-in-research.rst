 The National Academies Advisors to the Nation on Science, Engineering, and Medicine
*************************************************************************************

The **National Academy of Science** (NAS) [1]_ (created in 1863) is a
private, non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars
that are required to advise the federal government on scientific and
technical matters.

The **National Academy of Engineers** (NAE) [2]_ (created in 1964) is a
parallel organization to NAS that also advises the federal government.

The **Institute of Medicine** [3]_ (created in 1970) is a subsidiary of NAS
aimed at advising the government about public health policy matters.

The **National Research Council** [4]_ was created in 1916 to broadly advise
on research matters. It is now the primary concern of both NAS and NAE.

 Preface
*********

**Science is built upon trust**. When trust is misplaced and
professional standards are violated, researchers feel attacked that the
base of their profession has been undermined.

New researchers are not learning how to conduct themselves as scientists
(a broad definition that includes anyone who is involved with the
pursuit of knowledge) [5]_ . This used to be the responsiblility of more senior
researchers, as they are role models, teachers, and mentors to junior researchers. But as the speed of scientific developments accelerates, this task
is often ignored. Furthermore, exciting opportunities
keep appearing faster than science can keep up, further contributing to
the problem of not educating new researchers on best practices.

****************************************
 A Note on Using *On Being a Scientist*
****************************************

This book explores options for handling situations, not defining what
exactly to do in a particular situation. It should be read by a
group of researchers that discuss the topics within and figure out how
to apply the lessons to their practice [6]_ .


The existence of professional standards implies that there is a proper
way to go about a task or field. However, this book doesn't aim to cover
specifics. To address specific concerns, a committee consisting of a
diverse group of individuals from varying experience levels should be
formed to identify and discuss what is the professional standards.
Furthermore, if your professional has an established code of conduct or
professional standards, those should be referred to for specifics.

The material within this book is not exhaustive, and many texts and
websites now exist to help supplement this material.

*****************************************************
 Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research
*****************************************************

Researchers pride themselves on observing or explaining phenomenon which
haven't been seen or explained previously. However, researchers are
often under a great deal of personal and professional pressure; failure
to properly collect, report, or handle data, experiments, or papers can
result in lost time, money, and respect [7]_ .

Researchers have created professional standards over many centuries
for many different fields. It is therefore expected that researchers
will adhere to the standards of their respected fields.
A *scientific standard* is the application of the ethical values of
honesty, fairness, objectivity, openness, trustworthiness, and respect
for others [8]_.

Researchers have several obligations. Some of them include honoring their
colleagues trust, conducting themselves in a responsible manner, and to the
properly report their results to the public as their work has the potential to
impact policies at an international level. A researchers irresponsible actions
--- or *scientific misconduct* --- can potentially undermine an entire field and
cause permanent damage to their reputation. *Scientific misconduct* is defined
as, "fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or
reviewing researcher, or in reporting research results," by the US
government [9]_ :cite:p:`the_office_of_research_integrity_definition_nodate`.

************************
 Advising and Mentoring
************************

It is often best to build a diverse community of mentors as not one
person has the same experience, education, or background as another.

Being a mentor is not a one way street where the mentee only benefits.
As a mentor, you experience the benefits of being exposed to new ideas,
building a strong research program and collaboration network, and gain
new friends plus respect from beginning researchers. However, mentors
have influence over the start of a junior researcher's career, and must
therefore be careful not to abuse it. The main role of the mentor is to
help the mentee move along a productive and successful career
trajectory.

Mentees also have responsibilities towards their mentors. They need to
develop clear expectations regarding meeting times and availability with
their mentors, and need to seek out their mentors, rather than expect a
mentor to be provided to them.

*******************
 Treatment of Data
*******************

Researchers who maliciously manipulate data to deceive others violate
the basic values and accepted professional standards of science. In
doing so they mislead colleagues, potentially impede progress in their
field, undermine their own authority and trustworthiness, and they
introduce misinformation into both the scientific record and the public
sphere [10]_ .

To ensure the integrity of science, researchers have developed and
continually improve upon methods such as statistical tests of
significance, double-blind trials, and proper survey phrasing ensured by
the academic's relevant Internal Review Board (IRB). Because it is
paramount that the integrity of the work is valid, papers must include a
description of the methodology used to generate the data. This is
because if the methodology to generate the data is incorrect or not
present, then the integrity of the data and the work can be called into
question. Furthermore, this helps ensure the reproducibility of science [11]_ .

New researchers are not trained on how to generate, share, store, and
publish data. Additionally, new technologies to store, transmit,
generate, and analyze data are constantly being created. Thus
researchers face a dilemma of how to store data permanently so that it
can be used in future works (either by themselves or with others).
However, when academic works are released the data must be made
available. If a researcher refuses to share the data, then they fail to
maintain the standards of science [12]_ .

*************************
 Mistakes and Negligence
*************************

All science is susceptible to error. However, researchers have an
obligation to be as accurate and as careful as possible both for their
profession and the public.

To make progress, researchers must believe the works of other
researchers. It is well known that by, "looking for an answer", or
believing that there exists an answer prior to running experiments, that
researchers bias themselves to believe that something exists when it
doesn't [13]_ . However, these inaccuracies and mistakes must be remedied in
the scientific record as soon as they are identified so as to allow the
continue proliferation of science [14]_ .

*********************
 Research Misconduct
*********************

Scientific misconduct, as defined by the U.S. Office of Science and
Technology Policy, defines it as, "fabrication, falsification, or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in
reporting research results"
:cite:p:`the_office_of_research_integrity_definition_nodate`.

The specific definitions for fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism are:

- **Fabrication** is "making up data or results."
- **Falsification** is "manipulating research materials, equipment, or
  processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is
  not accurately represented in the research record."
- **Plagiarism** is "the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes,
  results, or words without giving appropriate credit."

Scientific misconduct significantly departs from accepted practices.
Identification requires that misconduct be proven to be

- intendend to decieve the scientific process [15]_ ,
- knowingly or recklessly conducted against norms, and
- a preponderance of evidence exists to prove the misconduct [16]_ .

To reduce scientific misconduct, co-authors should validate each others
work, as well as have third parties review their results prior to
publication. Misconduct can set back individuals, institutions, and research
fields. It can also draw the eye of the public and policy makers to make
decisions that are negative for the progression of science.

**************************************************************
 Responding to Suspected Violations of Professional Standards
**************************************************************

Science (typically) self-regulates itself [17]_ . Research communities
set standards and practices that researchers should follow. When confronting
others about results, retaliation can occur. Thankfully, this is prohibited by
U.S. laws :cite:p:`the_office_of_research_integrity_ori_2025`.

All research institutions that receive federal funding must have methods
to investigate and report misconduct. Anyone who is aware of misconduct
must follow these procedures.

All scientists and research institutions should discourage questionable
research practices (QRPs) [18]_ . Additionally, they need to take
responsibility in determining what QRPs warren reprimands from the
institution [19]_ .

To structure your thinking prior to confronting a researcher, consider talking
to a friend or advisor who can keep the situation confidential. To raise
suspicions about misconduct, ask neutral questions rather than be accusatory.
If your institution receives federal funding, to talk to your research integrity
officer. However, keep in mind your own motivations and biases prior to raising
questions so as to be courteous and kind.


****************************************************
 Human Participants and Animal Subjects in Research
****************************************************

Any research done on humans or animals is subject to federal, state,
local, and institutional regulations.

The U.S. federal regulations on experiments that involve humans is known
as the Common Rule :cite:p:`us_department_of_health_and_human_services_federal_2009`. \
The Common Rule specifies exactly what falls under the domain of human
participation in experiments. Furthermore, any research institution receiving
federal grants must have an IRB. The job of the IRB is to ensure that all
research involving human participants follows the Common Rule. Many private
institutions also have IRBs.

In some cases where human participation is required, formal training in
bioethics is needed to identify if the experiment is ethical towards the
participants. These issues are often evaluated by the committee's such
as the President's Council on Bioethics in the United States
:cite:p:`george_w_bush_presidents_2001`.

Animals also have federal protections with regard to animal
participation in experiments under the U.S. Federal Animal Welfare Act :cite:p:`us_department_of_agriculture_animal_2025`.
The U.S. Public Health Service's *Policy on the Human Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals* :cite:p:`us_department_of_health_and_human_services_phs_2015` applies
to all research supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH).
Additionally, the *Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals*
:cite:p:`national_research_council_guide_2011` is required to be followed by all
NIH funded research institutions. This ensures that all animal testing follows
the three R's:

- Reduction in the number of animals used,
- Refinement of techniques and procedures to reduce pain and distress,
- Replacement of conscious living higher animals with insentient material

Overseeing the ethical experimentation on animals is an institution's
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) [20]_ .

*******************************
 Laboratory Safety in Research
*******************************

Researchers should review safety information and procedures at least
once a year.

A shortlist of topics to review includes:

- Appropriate usage of protective equipment and clothing,
- Safe handling of materials in laboratories,
- Safe operation of equipment,
- Safe disposal of materials,
- Safety management and accountability,
- Hazard assessment processes,
- Safe transportation of materials between laboratories,
- Safe design of facilities,
- Emergency responses,
- Safety education of all personnel before entering the laboratory, and
- Applicable government regulations.

*****************************
 Sharing of Research Results
*****************************

In the 17th century, researchers kept their results secret in order to
protect their results from others claiming them. To solve this, Henry
Oldenburg :cite:p:`noauthor_henry_2025` started to guarantee that not only
researchers could have their results rapidly published, but that the Royal
Society of London :cite:p:`the_royal_society_royal_2025` would defend authors
integrity. He furthermore invented the modern review practice of sending out
manuscripts to experts prior to publication for review.

To publish in a peer-reviewed journal is often the most important way to
share information among researchers. This is because the first to
publish often gets the credit. Once results are published, others can
cite the author in their work. Unpublished manuscripts under review are
to be treated as confidential.

Citations need to be scrutinized during the peer-review process in order
to assess their validity and usefulness [21]_ . Researchers have a duty to
thoroughly search the available literature on a subject and attribute
all relevant authors.

Information can be disseminated through seminars, conferences,
abstracts, and posters as well as peer-reviewed journal papers. Often
considered to be preliminary in nature, spreading data, results, or
manuscripts that haven't been peer-reviewed online is possible as well [22]_ .
However, by bypassing traditional quality assurance measures,
researchers take on a risk that their work won't serve science well [23]_ .

Publishing or announcing results prior to peer-review is dangerous.
Without the peer-review checks, it is possible for misinformation to be
misinterpreted by the public, policy makers, and other researchers as
fact. Additionally, by posting information prior to a journal submission
online, it can be considered to be a "prior publication", thus making it
unusable for publishing within the journal.

Publication abuses are possible. For example, researchers may publish
the "least publishable unit" of information. This is when the smallest
number of results are collected or written about to be published, rather
than undergoing an intensive research process. This wastes the time and
energy of reviewers and can give the researcher a reputation of
producing shoddy or incomplete work.

*****************************************
 Authorship and the Allocation of Credit
*****************************************

When a paper is published, all of those that contributed to the paper
are considered authors and should be listed as such. Authorship
conventions and practices differ from field to field, and even lab to
lab :cite:p:`he_authorship_2024`. Open and honest conversations about how
authorship is handled is paramount to ensure that everyone knows the rules for
the author list order.

Honorary authors (i.e., those that contributed zero to little actual content
to the research) should not be added in the author list. They can be
acknowledged in an "Acknowledgment" section however. Additionally,
ghost-writers should not be used to write a paper.

All authors on a paper must take responsibility for the content of the
paper and must be able to answer questions about the research.

***********************
 Intellectual Property
***********************

Researchers should be aware of the potential monetary value that their
intellectual property has. Intellectual property is a legal right to
control the application of an idea within a specific context (through a
patent) or control the expression of an idea (through a copyright).

- Patent owners can protect their intellectual property rights by excluding
  others from making, using, or selling an invention so long as the patent owner
  provides a full description of how the invention is made, is used, and
  functions.

- Copyrights protect the expression or presentation of ideas, but they do not
  protect the ideas themselves.

Most research institutions have policies that detail how intellectual
policy rights should be handled. Additionally, patent and copyright laws
differ from country to country. Publication of work should not be
delayed because of a potential patent though.

**********************************************
 Competing Interests, Commitments, and Values
**********************************************

Conflict of interest refers to situations where researchers have
personal, intellectual, financial, and professional interests that
conflict with the ongoing research :cite:p:`long_fundamental_2019`. Conflicts of
financial interests undergo much scrutiny. Should research be done with a known
conflict of financial interest, it severely damages the researcher's credibility
and integrity. Timely and full disclosure of conflict of interests must be made
to governing bodies of science when requested.

Personal relationships can also conflict with research. Often journals
and funding agencies ask for personal relationships in order to identify
potential conflict of personal interests. Romantic relationships often
count as a personal conflict of interest.

Conflicts of commitment are different than conflict of interests. This
can cause significant strain on a researcher's life and should be
identified early.

The values that a researcher has can cause a conflict of interest as
well. Religious, philosophical, cultural, or political beliefs can all
cause conflicts of interests. Values cannot and should not be separated
from science, but should be acknowledged and understood while conducting
science.

***************************
 The Researcher in Society
***************************

Researchers have the duty to ensure that not only does their work
further science, but also improves the public's welfare. They are put
into an interesting situation within the public sphere and may have to
wear many hats. However, it is paramount that they remain honest, fair,
collegial, and open in society as these are all core scientific tenants
that researchers should follow.
