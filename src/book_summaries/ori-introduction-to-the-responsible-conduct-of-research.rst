 *ORI Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research*
###########################################################

:bdg-primary:`Book Summary` :bdg-primary-line:`Research`

by Nicholas H. Steneck, David Zinn, and Tommy G. Thompson :cite:p:`stenek_ori_2007`

**********
 Foreward
**********

This book is published by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) [1]_ as
supplemental material to assist in the teaching of the responsible
conduct of research. The ORI oversees and directs the Public Health
Service (PHS) [2]_ research integrety on behalf of the Secretary of Health
and Human Services [3]_ and the American public.

This book stems from the ethical concerns that were raised in biology related
fields in 1989 :cite:p:`lawrence_bioethics_2025` and has sinced expanded to
become more general and applicable to other disciplines.

*********
 Preface
*********

As the importance of science and technology increases, so too has the
public's demand for the responsible conduct of research. Simply put,
this means that good citizenship is applied to a researcher's
professional life. However, as each field is different, so too is the definition
of "good citizenship".

This book is written to briefly introduce researchers to what is generally
accepted as responsible conduct regardless of their working field.

********
 Part I
********

Chapter 1: Rules of the Road
============================

There aren't clear rules laid out to for researcher's to easily
understand what is and isn't responsible research conduct. Rather, there
are many organizing bodies, both official and non-official, that govern
this [4]_ . Furthermore, a researcher's personal judgement contributes to this
ethical calculus.

Some of the ethical and legal guidelines researchers have to adhere to include:

- Professional Codes,
- federal,
- State,
- institutional policies, and
- personal judgement.

Not all professions have Professional Codes. federal regulations have to first
be made available for public comment in the *federal Register* [5]_ , and once
accepted, are incorporated into the *Code of federal Regulations* [6]_ and
must be followed. Researchers are advised to seek help in understanding
federal rules.

Chapter 2: Research Misconduct
==============================

It is assumed that research misconduct is under reported. Regardless, misconduct
taints the public image of research, wastes donated or tax-funded dollars, and
harms both the professional reputations of researchers and institutions.

Research misconduct policies provide guidance on responsible conduct in
these three areas:

 1. Establish definitions for misconduct in research,
 2. Outline procedures for reporting and investigating misconduct, and
 3. Provide protection for whistleblowers and person accused of misconduct.

federal regulations for research misconduct technically only apply at
the federal level, but many institutions incorporate and expand it
within their own policies. The Office of Science and Technology Policy [7]_
(OSTP) --- a federal agency --- defines research misconduct as:

"fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or
reviewing research, or in reporting research results,"
:cite:p:`office_of_science_and_technology_policy_office_2025` .

For an action to be considered research misconduct, it must meet the following
criteria:

1. Represent a, "significant departure from accepted practices",
2. Have been, "committed intentionally, or knowingly, or recklessly", and
3. Be, "proven by a preponderance of evidence".

The violation of

- federal rules,
- abuse of confidentiality,
- authorship and publication violations,
- failure to report misconduct,
- obstruction of misconduct investigations, and
- other institutional level policies

can also be classified as research misconduct.

Research misconduct puts a researcher's career on the
line. However, researchers accused of research misconduct only face punishment
when proven guilty.

OSTP puts the responsibility of research misconduct
reporting and investigation on both *researchers* and *their research
institutions*. Research misconduct whistleblowers run the risk of illegal
retaliation when reporting to governing bodies.

Chapter 3: The Protection of Human Subjects
===========================================

All human subjects must have to informed consent and the right to
withdraw from experiments conducted on them.

Human subjects are used in order to find improvements to the human
experience. This could involve the creation of new medicines, surgeries,
or experiments [9]_ . There is an ethical concern in human subjects
research that some experiments have risks without any benefits.

Researchers who use human subjects are subject to federal regulations.
Both the Nuremberg Code :cite:p:`allied_control_council_no_10_nuremberg_nodate`
and the Declaration of Helsinki :cite:p:`the_world_medical_association_declaration_nodate`
are guidelines that are to be followed when testing on human subjects.

Additionally, the federal regulation 45 CFR 46 Subparts A - D, known as the
"Common Rule" :cite:p:`us_department_of_health_and_human_services_federal_2009` ,
are expected to be followed as well. Exempt research from the "Common Rule"
include:

- Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings,
- Research involving the use of educational tests,
- Research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents,
  records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if unidentifiable or
  publicly availible,
- Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or subject to the
  approval of department or agency heads, and
- Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies.

Furthermore, all researchers working with human subjects must undergo National
Institutes of Health (NIH) [10]_ training.

Any institution that performs human research must have a federally
mandated Internal Review Board (IRB). It must consist of at least 5 people
including one member who is a scientist, one is not a scientist, and one
who is not affiliated with the institution.

Chapter 4: The Welfare of Laboratory Animals
============================================

Research on animal subjects is done to benefit humans without
experimenting on humans. The 1966 Animal Welfare Act :cite:p:`us_department_of_agriculture_animal_2025`
and the 1985 Health and Research Extension Act :cite:p:`united_states_national_archives_and_records_administration_office_of_the_federal_register_health_1985`
both act as federal regulations that researcher's experimenting on human
subjects must abide by.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [11]_ is
responsible for the transportation, care, and use of animals. The usage of
animals for biomedical and behavioral research is subject to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services (HHS) [3]_ , acting through the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) [12]_ .
Furthermore, activists have put together guidelines through the Animal
Care Panel (ACP), commonly reffered to as the *Guide* :cite:p:`national_research_council_guide_2011`.
The Guide is widely accepted both in public and private institutions and
federal laboratories.

The definition of an animal from the PHS Policy is:

   "any live, vertebrate animals used or inteded for use in research, research
   training, experimentation, or biological testing or for related
   purposes." :cite:p:`us_department_of_health_and_human_services_phs_2015`

The definition of an animal from the Common Rule that includes warm blooded
animals (mammals) but excludes:

   "Birds, rats of the genus Rattus and mice of the
   genus Mus bred for use in research, and horses not used for research
   purposes and other farm animals".

Prior to using animal subjects, researchers must defend the usage of
animal subjects against the "three R's":

1. **Replacement** - using non-animal models such asmicroorganisms or cell culture
   techniques, computer simulations, or species lower on the phulogenetic scale,

2. **Reduction** - using methods aimed at reducing the numbers of animals such as
   minimization of variability, appropriate selection of animal model,
   minimization of animal loss, and careful experimental design, and

3. **Refinement** - the elimination or reduction of unnecessary pain and
   distress in animal subjects.

Institutions testing on animals must create an Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) which acts similarly to an IRB but for
animals. These, along with the OLAW, USDA, and accrediation programs,
are responsible for the proper care and respect of animal subjects.

Chapter 5: Conflicts of Interest
================================

Researchers can experience three different types of conflicts of
interest:

1. Financial gain,
2. Work commitments, and
3. Intellectual and personal matters.

Financial gains involve reciving money from an institute that the
researcher has a vested in. This could involve having stock in the
company, or being a member of the company.

Work commitments involve colluding multiple working positions into one
in order to serve a singular purpose. In other words, if a position at
work is being used to further a research objective or vice versa, it is
a conflict of interest.

Intellectual and personal matter conflicts of interest occur when the
idealogy, beliefs, or viewpoint of a researcher could interfere with
their research objectives.

Chapter 6: Data Management Practices
====================================

Research is not possible without data. Because of this, there are
responsibilities that researchers have to the proper ownership,
collection, storage, and sharing of data [13]_ . When sharing data with others,
it must be fully validated, be finalized, and can be confidential until
publication.

Data can be owned by one or many sources. This includes:

- the funders of the research,
- the institution where the research was conducted, and
- the original source of the data.

Typically, government funded research allows the data to be shared for the
public good, privately funded research retain the right to disseminate the data,
and philinthropic funding sources retain or give away their data ownership
rights depending on their motive.

Data must be collected responsibly through appropriate and reliable methods If
these methods are unreliable, the the resulting data will also be
unreliable [14]_ . The data  collected must be detailed enough to support the
results. It must also be authorized for collection, and when recorded, proper
metadata must be captured to include the date, time, source, and other important
facts about the source of the data.

After collecting the data, it must be stored properly so as to prevent
the theivery or loss of data. This includes securing lab notebooks and
regularly backing up data files. Additionally, any data that includes
personal identifying information or is otherwise confidential, must go
through a process of anonymizing the data so as to respect the source's
privacy. Furthermore, some data may be subject to a period of retention
and if not, data should otherwise be retained indefinetly.

Finally, future considerations about the data must be taken into
account. For example, the generated data of an experiment can be larger
than the amount of usable computer storage. Furthermore, there is now a
concern that released data can contribute to the terrorism or foreign
entities that wish to do harm to the American public. Ethical concerns
about the release of such data must be taken into consideration prior to
releasing said data.


Chapter 7: Mentor and Trainee Responsibilities
==============================================

Trainee refers to anyone learning to be a researcher learning from a
senior researcher. To establish the basic understandings of the
relationship, trainees must know from their mentors:

- How much time they are expected to put into research,
- How performance is judged,
- How responsibilities are shared or divided,
- Standard operating procedures, and
- How credit and authorship are assigned.

Whereas mentors expect from their trainees that they:

- Do work in a conscientious way,
- Respect the authority of others,
- Follow research regulations and protocols, and
- Live by agreements established for authorship and ownership

To make sure these expectations are clear, the mentor should lay them
out initally. Furthermore, mentors have are expected to supervise the
work of a trainee. This results in the monitoring, support, and review
of a trainees work, as well as imparting the ethos of being a researcher
onto them.

The research environment that they mentor creates and the trainee learns
in should be one of:

- Equal treatment free from discrimination,
- Professional, and
- Follow the responsible conduct of research

Postdoctoral researchers have a rough time in the lab as they have the
skills to be an independent researcher, but since they are no longer
students nor faculty, they have little rights. Additionally, since they
are working under someone else's funding, they have little freedom to
pursue their own research. The National Postdoctoral Association [15]_ has
been created to ensure that postdocs have the rights that they deserve
with respect to transitioning to independent researchers.

Chapter 8: Collaborative Research
=================================

Collaborative research involves any time when two or more researchers
collaborate on the same project. This could involve researchers from the
same institution or different insititutions. This work is led by a
primary investigator (PI) who heads the project and is responsible for
the compliance of rules and responsible research conduct, financials,
and training.

Collaborative research projects need to initially solve many problems
with respect to:

- The goals of the project and anticipated outcomes,
- Everyone's role,
- How data will be collected, stored, and shared,
- How changes in the research design will be made,
- Who is responsible for drafting publications,
- The criteria to identify and rank authorship,
- Who is responsible for submitting reports and meeting other requirements,
- Who is responsible for publicly speaking about the work,
- How intellectural property rights and ownership issues will be resolved, and
- How collaboration can be changed and when it comes ot an end.

With respect to compliance, it is best practice to work under the
compliance guidelines of the institution or state that has the strictest
policies to ensure that all researchers are following proper protocol.

Chapter 9: Authorship and Publication
=====================================

All forms of publication should present:

- A full and fair description of the work done,
- An accurate report of the results,
- An honest and open assessment of the findings,
- The methods of the researcher,
- What the results are, and
- A discussion of the results to better understand their impact.

Authorship serves to let others know who conducted the research and
should get credit for it. It is generally limited to those who were:

- Intimately involved in the conception and design of the research,
- Assumed responsibility for data collection and interpretation,
- Participated in the drafting of the publication, and
- Approved the final version of the publication.

There is disagreement as to whether a researcher needs to adhere to all
of these rules in order to be consider an author. The International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) [16]_ have created the *Uniform
Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals*
:cite:p:`international_committee_of_medical_journal_editors_recommendations_2025`
which lists out the following criteria for authorship:

1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data,
   or analysis and interpretation of data,
2. Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual
   content, and
3. Final approval of the version to be published

Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.

The ICMJE guidelines are strict and are not followed by all disciplines.

The first and last author on a paper carry weight. What this weight
means is dependent upon the field that it is published in.

The corresponding or primary author of the paper is the individual who
can intimately describe the work and is the public relations individual
of the work.

A manuscript should include:

- An abstract to summarize the content of the paper,
- A methods section to describe the research methods to create the results,
- A results section to talk about what was found,
- A discussion section to describe what the results mean, and
- A notes, bibliography, and acknowledgments section to acknowledge the work of
  previous researchers or minor authors to the paper

The following authorship practices should be avoided:

- Honorary authorship,
- Salami publications (using the same data/ study in two seperate papers),
- Duplicate publications, and
- Premature public statments

Chapter 10: Peer Review
=======================

Peer review is an essential component of the research process, carried out by
fellow researchers—typically within the same field—who evaluate the quality,
rigor, and significance of scholarly work. This evaluative process is used in a
variety of contexts, including grant applications, manuscript submissions,
personnel decisions, and the preparation of literature reviews or expert
testimony.

Effective peer review adheres to several key principles. Reviews must be
completed in a timely manner and should be thorough in their assessment of the
material. They must also be constructive, offering feedback that can help
strengthen the work, and they should be free from personal bias. Additionally,
reviewers are expected to respect the confidentiality of the materials they
assess.

The primary purpose of peer review is to determine the quality of the work under
consideration. Reviewers examine whether the research methods used are
appropriate, verify calculations and the logic behind important arguments,
ensure that the conclusions are supported by the evidence provided, and confirm
that all relevant literature has been properly consulted and cited. When
reviewers identify issues—such as careless errors in data reporting or
citations, deliberate fabrication or falsification of results, plagiarism,
inaccurate disclosures of conflicts of interest or authorship, or the omission
of key prior work—the integrity of the research is called into question.

In addition to evaluating quality, peer reviewers also judge the importance of
the work. They may ask whether a proposed research project is worth pursuing,
whether specific results merit publication, whether a researcher has made
meaningful contributions to their field, or whether the evidence presented is
substantial enough to inform policy decisions. Because these judgments
inherently involve subjective interpretation, some degree of personal bias is
unavoidable. To mitigate the influence of such bias, reviewers are encouraged to
write transparent reviews that openly acknowledge their own perspectives and
reference any sources or prior work that shaped their assessments.

Confidentiality is a cornerstone of the peer-review process, protecting both
authors and reviewers and encouraging frank, honest evaluations without fear of
personal or professional repercussions. Many venues employ double-blind review
systems in which neither the authors nor the reviewers know one another's
identities. To maintain the integrity of this system, reviewers must follow
strict ethical guidelines. It is inappropriate to delegate a review to students
or colleagues, to use ideas or information from a confidential proposal or
manuscript before it becomes public, or to discuss submissions under review with
others --- whether in one's department or at professional meetings. Reviewers
must not retain copies of reviewed materials once the process is complete, nor
should they discuss personnel or hiring evaluations with individuals who are not
formally part of the review process.

********
 Part V
********

It is well understood that many people early in their career have
irresponsible research conduct. Additionally, what might be considered
responsible conduct in one field may not apply to all fields. None the
less, there is no justification for comprimising the core tennants of
research: honesty, accuracy, efficiency, and objectivity. Upholding
these is the responsibility of all researchers.
